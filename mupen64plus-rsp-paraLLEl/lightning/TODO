	* Validate that divrem in jit_x86-cpu.c is not modifying
	the non result arguments. This is not verified by clobber.tst,
	as it only checks registers not involved in the operation
	(because it does not know about values being set as input
	for the the operation).

	* Write a simple higher level language implementation generating
	jit with lightning, that could be some lisp or C like language.

	* rerun ./configure --enable-devel-get-jit-size and regenerate
	the related jit_$arch-sz.c for the ports where nodata is
	meaningful:
	hppa		(done)
	i586		(done)
	ia64
	mips o32	(done)
	mips n32
	mips n64
	powerpc 32	(done)
	powerpc 64	(done)
	ppc
	s390x		(done)
	sparc		(done)
	x86_64		(done)
	Missing ones are due to no longer (remote) access to such hosts
	and may be broken with jit_set_data(..., JIT_DISABLE_DATA).
	(ia64 hp-ux or linx), (irix mips for 32 or 64 abi), and
	(darwin ppc).
